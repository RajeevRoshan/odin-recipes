        <h4>Recipe Instruction Step By Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan. Season the aubergine slices and fry them in batches for 3–4 minutes on each side, until golden and tender, adding more oil as necessary. Transfer the slices to a plate as they are cooked.</li>
            <li>Tip the tomatoes into the pan along with any juice and stir into the onion. Cook for 8 minutes until the tomatoes have broken down and softened – they should be a pulp.</li>
            <li>Pour in the tomato juice and cook, again over a low heat, for 5 minutes. The sauce will be quite thick by this stage.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, black pepper and the cumin, if using.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of aubergine slices over a large, ovenproof dish, then spoon over half the tomato sauce. Repeat to make two layers.</li>
