        <h4>Recipe Instruction Step by Step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a dry frying pan and toast the spices quickly till they become aromatic. Remove and keep on the side.</li>
            <li>Slice on onion in half and char it flat side down in a hot, dry pan until black. Remove, and add the ginger until coloured on both sides.</li>
            <li>Debone the short ribs, browning the bone in a dry pan on every side.</li>
            <li>Add the bone to the crockpot with stock, water, onion, the garlic clove, spices, ginger, coriander stalks and shiitake mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Slice the short rib lengthways in thin slices and add to the pot.</li>
            <li>For best results, set your Crock-Pot or slow cooker to low (for 4 to 6 hours' cooking). You could also use high (for 2 to 3 hours' cooking).</li>
            <li>Cook until the beef gets soft to the bite but does not break up.</li>
            <li>Add fish sauce and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Remove the bones, spices, ginger, garlic and lemongrass, then portion into bowls with the prepared noodles.</li>
            <li>Slice the spring onion and chilli, add to the pho and top with lightly torn coriander leaves and mint. Serve with lime wedges.</li>
